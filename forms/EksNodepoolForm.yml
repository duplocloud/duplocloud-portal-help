name: Specify name of the node pool.
expireAfter: Speciy in hours. This configuration means the node pool will expire and be deleted after the specified hours.
terminationGracePeriod: |
  Specify Termination Grace Period in hours.
  Time given to node for pod draining before force deleting pods and removing the node.
  In EKS Auto Mode this is implicitly set to 24 hours when omitted. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-pool.html#_termination_grace_period).
cpu: |
  Specify CPU limit.
  Ceiling on how many cpu resources a nodepool can cumulatively consume by scaling nodes.
  When defined, nodepool stops scaling if it takes cpu consumption beyond cpu limit.
  Omitting limit means not specifying an upper bound for cpu consumption. For details, see [here](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodepools/#speclimits)
memory: |
  Specify Memory limit.
  Ceiling on how much memory a nodepool can cumulatively consume by scaling nodes.
  When defined, nodepool stops scaling if it takes memory consumption beyond this limit.
  Omitting limit means not specifying an upper bound for memory consumption. For details, see [here](https://karpenter.sh/docs/concepts/nodepools/#speclimits)
consolidationPolicy: |
 Select to determine how EKS handles potential disruptions to running workloads when performing node consolidation.
 1. **WhenEmpty:** Nodes are only considered for disruption (removal or replacement) if they have no running pods. 
 2. **WhenEmpty or Underutilized:** Nodes are considered for disruption if they are empty OR if they have been underutilized for a specified duration (defined by `Consolidate After`). 
consolidateAfter: Specify in minutes. Defines how long a node should be idle (underutilized) before it's considered for consolidation (i.e., termination and replacement for cost/performance optimization).
