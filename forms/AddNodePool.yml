Name: Specify the name for your Node Pool.
Zones: Specify the zone for your Node Pool.
InstanceType: Select the machine type.
AutoscalingEnabled:  Enable autoscaler configuration for this node pool. Per zone limits will enforce given limits on a per zone basis.
UseTotalCount: Enable to limit total number of nodes independently of the spreading.
InitialNodeCount: Specify initial number of nodes.
MinNodeCount: Minimum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be less than or equal to Maximum Node Count.
MaxNodeCount: Maximum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be greater than or equal to Maximum Node Count.
LocationPolicy: |
  Select the Location Policy.
  1. **BALANCED:** autoscaler tries to spread the nodes equally among zones.
  2. **ANY:** autoscaler prioritize utilization of unused reservations and to account for current resource availability constraints.
ImageType: Select the Image Type.
DiscType: |
  Select the Disk Type.
  1. **Standard:** Suitable for large data processing workloads that primarily use sequential I/Os.
  2. **Balanced:** This disk type offers performance levels suitable for most general-purpose applications at a price point between that of standard and performance (pd-ssd) persistent disks.
  3. **SSD:** Suitable for enterprise applications and high-performance databases that require lower latency and more IOPS than standard persistent disks provide.
DiscSizeGb: Specify Boot Disk Type in GB per node.
Spot: When specified, the node pool will provision Spot instances. Spot Instances are ideal for fault-tolerant workloads and may be terminated at any time.
cgroupMode: Select the Cgroup Policy. Defaults to `Cgroupv2`.
LoggingConfig: |
  Select the logging config parameter for specifying the type of logging agent used in a node pool.
  1. **Default:** Select default logging variant.
  2. **Max Throughput:** Maximum logging throughput variant.
Tags: Enter the Network Tags. Multiple Network tags can be specified.
AutoRepair: Whether or not the nodes will be automatically repaired.
Sysctls: |
  Specify Linux Node Sysctl. For Sysctl Configuration options, click [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-system-config#sysctl-options).
  Refer example here.
  ```js
  {
      "net.core.somaxconn": "2048",
      "net.ipv4.tcp_rmem": "4096 87380 6291456"
  }
  ```
ResourceLabels: |
  Labels are applied to all nodes.
  ```js
   {
       "key" : "value"
   }
   ```
Metadata: |
  Configure Compute Engine instance metadata.
   ```js
   {
       "key" : "value"
   }
   ```
UpdateStrategy: |
  Select Upgrade Strategy. Defaults to Surge upgrade. For more details, click [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-upgrades?&_ga=2.113758275.-535098261.1654188041#surge).
MaxSurge: Max surge is the maximum number of nodes that can be created beyond the current size of the node pool during the upgrade process.
MaxUnavailable: Max unavailable is the maximum number of nodes that can be simultaneously unavailable during the upgrade process. A node is considered available if its status is Ready.
AllocationTags: Allocation tags is the simplest way to constraint containers/pods with hosts/nodes. DuploCloud/Kubernetes Orchestrator will make sure containers will run on the hosts having same allocation tags.
AutoUpgrade: Enable node auto-upgrade for the node pool. If enabled, node auto-upgrade helps keep the nodes in your node pool up to date with the latest release version of Kubernetes.
TotalMinNodeCount: Specify minimum number of all nodes.
TotalMaxNodeCount: Specify maximum number of all nodes.
NodePoolSoakDuration: Time needed after draining entire blue pool. After this period, blue pool will be cleaned up. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example- `3.5s`
BatchNodeCount: Number of blue nodes to drain in a batch. Only one of the batch_percentage or batch_node_count can be specified.
BatchPercentage: Percentage of the bool pool nodes to drain in a batch. The range of this field should be (0.0, 1.0). Only one of the batch_percentage or batch_node_count can be specified.
BatchSoakDuration: Enter Soak time after each batch gets drained. A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example- `3.5s`.
