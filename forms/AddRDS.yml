MinCapacity: Set the minimum capacity unit for the DB cluster. Each capacity unit is equivalent to a specific compute and memory configuration.
MaxCapacity: Set the maximum capacity unit for the DB cluster. Each capacity unit is equivalent to a specific compute and memory configuration.
AutoPause: Specify the amount of time to pass with no database traffic before you scale to zero processing capacity. When database traffic resumes, your Serverless cluster resumes processing capacity and scales to handle the traffic.\
AutoPauseDuration: Amount of time the cluster can be idle before scaling to zero
DBParameterGroupName: Database parameters group name.
ClusterParameterGroupName: Cluster parameters group name.
EncryptionKey: Choose to encrypt the given instance.
