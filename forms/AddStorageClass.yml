name: Storage Class Name.
provisioner: Each StorageClass has a provisioner that determines what volume plugin is used for provisioning PVs. This field must be specified.
reclaimPolicy: |
  PersistentVolumes that are dynamically created by a StorageClass will have the reclaim policy specified in the reclaimPolicy field of the class, which can be either `Delete`or `Retain`. If no reclaimPolicy is specified when a StorageClass object is created, it will default to `Delete`.
  PersistentVolumes that are created manually and managed via a StorageClass will have whatever reclaim policy they were assigned at creation.
volumeBindingMode: |
  The Volume Binding Mode field controls when volume binding and dynamic provisioning should occur. When unset, `Immediate` mode is used by default.  
  The `Immediate` mode indicates that volume binding and dynamic provisioning occurs once the PersistentVolumeClaim is created. 
  For storage backends that are topology-constrained and not globally accessible from all Nodes in the cluster, PersistentVolumes will be bound or provisioned without knowledge of the Pod's scheduling requirements. 
  This may result in unschedulable Pods.  
  A cluster administrator can address this issue by specifying the `WaitForFirstConsumer` mode which will delay the binding and provisioning of a PersistentVolume until a Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created. PersistentVolumes will be selected or provisioned conforming to the topology that is specified by the Pod's scheduling constraints. 
allowVolumeExpansion: PersistentVolumes can be configured to be expandable. This feature when set to true, allows the users to resize the volume by editing the corresponding PVC object.
parameters: |
  Define cloud-specific key/value settings for the StorageClass. Enter values required by your cloud provider to configure the volumes correctly, such as disk type, storage SKU, or secrets for access. If you don't specify a storage class for a persistent volume, the default storage class is used.

  Below is an example for Azure:
  ```yml
  skuName: Premium_ZRS
  kind: Managed
  storageaccounttype: Premium_LRS
  resourceGroup: rg-duplo-storage-account
  secretName: storage-account-volume-secret
  shareName: storage-account-file-share
  ```
storageClassAnnotations: |
  Kubernetes annotations in key value format. Sample value is like below
  ```yml
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  ```
storageClassLabels: |
  Kubernetes labels in key value format. Sample value is like below
  ```yml
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  ```
allowedTopologies: |
  When a cluster operator specifies the `WaitForFirstConsumer` volume binding mode, it is no longer necessary to restrict provisioning to specific topologies in most situations. However, if still required, `allowedTopologies` can be specified.
  Sample Value Allowed Toplogies
  ```yml
  - matchLabelExpressions:
    - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
      values:
      - us-central-1a
      - us-central-1b
  ```
