ServiceName: Enter a unique name for your service. Must start with a letter and can include letters, numbers, and hyphens, and be 2-45 characters.
cloud: Select the cloud provider where this service will run (AWS, Azure, GCP).
agentPlatforms: Select the application platform for the service. For example, Linux Docker/Native.
ImageName: Enter the Docker image name for this service, including repository and tag if applicable.
AllocationTag: |
  Enter a tag that matches a corresponding allocation tag on a host. 
  Only hosts with a matching allocation tag will run this service. 
  For example, if you want the service to run only on hosts tagged 'web', 
  set the allocation tag here to 'web'. If no host has the tag, the service 
  will not be deployed.
IsDaemonset: |
  Enable this option to run one instance of the service on every host 
  in the selected tenant. This ensures the service is deployed across all hosts.
IsAnyHostAllowed: |
  If "Yes", the service can run on any host in the same plan as
  the selected tenant.
asgName: |
  Selecting an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) ensures that the replicas of
  this service match the nodes in the ASG.
  Any value set for replicas in this form will be overridden.
ReplicaCollocation: When enabled, multiple replicas of the same
  service can be allocated to same node. When disabled, each replica needs to be on a separate host (a single host
  can still hold containers from different services).
LBSyncedDeployment: Enables Zero Downtime Updates. When enabled, each replica is drained from the load 
  balancer before being updated and then re-added afterward. This ensures zero downtime 
  but slows the rollout. When disabled, updates occur sequentially without load balancer 
  coordination, which may cause brief service glitches (5–20 seconds).
LivenessProbe: |
  Define the liveness probe for the container. For example:
  ```js
  {
      "failureThreshold":3,

      "httpGet":{
          "path":"/healthz/live",
          "port":80,

            "scheme":"HTTP"
      },
      "periodSeconds":10,
      "successThreshold":1,

      "timeoutSeconds":5
  }
  ```
ReadinessProbe: |
  Define the readiness probe for the container. For example:
  ```js
  {
      "failureThreshold":3,

      "httpGet": 
      {
          "path":"/healthz/ready",
          "port":80,

          "scheme":"HTTP"
      },
      "periodSeconds":10,
      "successThreshold":1,

      "timeoutSeconds":5
  }
  ```
securityContext: |
  Define the security context for the service. For example:
  ```js
  {
    "Capabilities":
    {
      "Add": [
        "NET_BIND_SERVICE"
      ],
      "Drop":
    [
        "ALL"
      ]
    },
    "ReadOnlyRootFilesystem": false,

    "RunAsNonRoot": true,
    "RunAsUser": 1000
  }
  ```
k8sPodConfig: |
  Pass generic Kubernetes Pod configurations, such as resource limits or a restart policy. As an example: 
  ```js
  {
    "RestartPolicy":
    "Always",
    "envFrom": [
      {
        "configMapRef": {
          "name":
    "api-configs"
        }
      },
      {
        "secretRef": {

          "name": "api-secrets"
        }
      },
      {
        "configMapRef":
    {
          "name": "api-db",
          "optional": true
        }

      }
    ],
    "resources": {
      "limits": {
        "memory":
    "1Gi"
      },
      "requests": {
        "memory": "384Mi"

      }
    }
  }
  ```
podSecurityContext: |
  Define security settings to apply to all containers in the Pod, 
  such as user/group IDs and file system permissions. For example: 
  ```js
  {
  "FsGroup":1001,
  "RunAsUser":1001
  }
  ```
EnvVariablesK8s: |-
  Enter environment variables to be passed to the containers in the YAML format. For example:
  ```yaml
  ---
  - Name: DB_HOST
    Value: abc.com
  - Name: DB_USER
    Value: myuser
  - Name: DB_PASSWORD
    Value: mypassword
  # using secrets
  - Name: SECRET_USERNAME
    ValueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: mysecret
        key: username
  # using ConfigMap data 
  - Name: LOG_LEVEL
    ValueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: env-config
        key: log_level
  ```
NetworkMode: Select 'Host Network' to share the host's networking stack. Container ports are accessible directly on the host without explicit port mapping.
ReplicationStrategy: |
  Choose how replicas are managed:
    1. **Static**: This option can be used to set a fixed count for the replicas.
    2. **Daemonset**: If this option is selected, pods run on every host in the tenant.
    3. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Automatically scales replicas up or down based on metrics like CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Ingress requests per second, etc. For more information, [Click Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/).
HPAConfig: |-
  Enter horizontal pod autoscaler specifications as documented [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale-walkthrough/). Sample values are shown below:
  ```yaml
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
    - resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          averageUtilization: 80
          type: Utilization
      type: Resource
  minReplicas: 2
  ```
envVariables: |
  Pass environment variables in json format. Refer to the sample below.
  ```js
  {
      "discovery.type": "single-node",
       "plugins.security.disabled" : "true",
       "compatibility.override_main_response_version" : "true"
  }
  ```
dockerNetwork: Optionally, specify additional network settings beyond the default container network.
ReplicaPlacement: |
  Select how replicas are placed.
  1. **First Available**: Replicas prefer, but are not required to be scheduled on different hosts.
  2. **Place on Different Hosts**: Replicas are required to be placed on different hosts.
  3. **Spread Across Zones**: Replicas are required to be spread across availability zones and prefer, but are not required to be scheduled on different hosts.
  4. **Different Hosts and Spread Across Zones**: Replicas must be on separate hosts and spread across zones.
TolerateSpotInstance: Select to run pods in Spot Instance. Relevant tolerations are added automatically in 'Other Container Config'.
Replicas: Specify the number of replicas for the service.
ForceStatefulSet: Enable this option to create the service as a StatefulSet.
AppName: Optionally, enter an App Name to group services. This helps filter services belonging to the same app.
